# CourseMate 📅  
*A simple class scheduling system for students*  

## 📖 About  
ClassTrack is a lightweight web application that helps students manage their class schedules with ease.  
Instead of asking the course rep about today’s classes, students can log in and instantly see:  
- Today’s schedule (time, course, and venue)  
- Ability to add/update schedules  
- Simple login system for personal schedules  

It works like a mini **Google Calendar**, but focused on **students and timetables**.

## 🛠 Features  
- 🔑 User login & logout  
- 📅 Add schedules for specific days of the week  
- ⏰ View today’s schedule automatically  
- 🏫 Course name + time + venue details
